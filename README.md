# King's Cup API Documentation

Welcome to the King's Cup API, a .NET-based service designed to bring the classic party game to life digitally. Currently featuring a handful of essential endpoints, this API serves as the foundation for an interactive King's Cup experience.

## Current Endpoints

### /api/game/draw

- **GET**: Draw Card.

### /api/game/rule/{rank}

- **GET**: Get rule for a card rank.

### /api/game/rule/deck

- **GET**: Current state of the deck

### /api/welcome

- **GET**: Show the welcome message.

### /api/welcome/rules

- **GET**: This will return a dictionary of all the rules.


## Planned Features

In the upcoming updates, I aim to expand the functionality of the API and enhance the user interface to provide a more immersive and customizable King's Cup experience. Planned features include:

- **Dynamic Rules Management**: Enable the addition, modification, and removal of game rules via API endpoints.
- **Game Progress Tracking**: Implement endpoints to track the game's progress, including current player turns and the state of the game.
- **Real-time Updates**: Integrate WebSocket support for real-time updates to players and spectators.
- **Player Interactions**: Allow players to interact with the game via API calls, such as drawing cards or performing rule-based actions.

## Future UI Enhancements

To complement the robust API, I will also revamp the user interface with modern design principles and interactive elements. Key UI enhancements will include:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Streamline player interactions and provide clear visual feedback.
- **Customization Options**: Allow users to personalize their game settings and preferences.
